# video-rating-animation

I did an experiment where I showed videos to people and ask them to rate the video continuosly on some question.
I wanted to get a visualization in which
- above video clip is shown
- below the moment to moment rating trace is shown

In this repository there are 3 scripts.  
__Script 1__: loads a video and writes out all the frames as png images.  
__Script 2__: creates subplots in which on the top panel each frame of the video is shown and on the lower panel a corresponding rating trace is shown and writes each subplot out as png images.   
__Script 3__: Puts every frame together as a video animation.
